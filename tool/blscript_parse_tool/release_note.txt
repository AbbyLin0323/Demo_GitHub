v1.0.2beta:
1. change list file to like the following:
   "0B0000003412F81F34120000" --> "0000000B 1FF81234 00001234"
   binary file is still little-endian mode, so need to modify code that parse list file to binary file.
2. delete assert and __debugbreak(), only printf error information, then return.

v1.0.1beta:
1. only provide 4k parameter binary file to de-compile, and the parse config file name should be defined by yourself.
2. support <hw_init> is used as common register setting for all platform. each board can have its special register setting for the same ftable id.
you can write as the following:
(1)
/main.cfg
    ......
    include "CRB/clock_crb.cfg"
    ...... 

/hw_init/clock_common.cfg
    ftableid clock_id
    ...... 

/CRB/clock_crb.cfg
    ftableid clock_id 1
    include /hw_init/clock_common.cfg
    ...... 

(2)
/main.cfg
    ......
    include "/hw_init/clock_common.cfg"
    include "/CRB/clock_crb.cfg"
    ...... 

/hw_init/clock_common.cfg
    ftableid clock_id
    ...... 

/CRB/clock_crb.cfg
    ftableid clock_id 1
    ......

v1.0.0beta
1. Main.cfg and include file can support both absolute and relative path.
2. If not set the absolute path, the root path will be set to be the directory of EXE by default.
3. Output file is in the root path, the absolute path you set or the relative to the EXE path.
4. To get the help info, you can use "bl_parameter_compile.exe /?", or "bl_parameter_compile.exe -h" or   "bl_parameter_compile.exe -hel".
5. Show the tool version at the beginning.
6. Don't pause after finish running.

20160728:
1. fix must add an empty line after the last line if the last line is an opcoe with any parameter.
   string copy in GetOneValue() should limit the copy length.
2. fix if some .cfg file with ftableid is empty, the opcode in main.cfg couldn't be write in the right location.

20160726:
1.support many "main.cfg", select the directory of the "main.cfg" which you want to use in "blscript_parse.bat".
the directory just like:
blscript\
 hw_init\
   + clockgating\
   + dram\
   + global\
   + nfc\
   + sdc\
 CRB_A\
   + clockgating\
   + main.cfg
   + ptable.cfg
 CRB_B\
   + dram\
   + main.cfg
   + ptable.cfg
 EVB_TP\
   + nfc\
   + main.cfg
   + ptable.cfg
 EVB_BJ\
   + main.cfg
   + ptable.cfg
 output\
   + *.lst
   + Bootloader_Parameter.bin
   + Bootloader.bin
   + main_parse.cfg

 bl_parameter_compile.exe
 blscript_parse.bat
